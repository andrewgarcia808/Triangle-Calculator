# Triangle-Calculator

In this Repo, you will find the raw code in the Calculator.cpp file. You can use a compiler online such as cpp.sh
or you can compile it in Windows Visual Studios.

Thank You


Update:
I noticed that my code was running into an infinate loop. Problem was fixed in the check_input() function. 
I just downloaded Visual Studios and compiled the file into a exe file. Now you can download it and run it and it will work.
